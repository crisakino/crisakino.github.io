<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/304577213">Just Friends</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user89620006">Cristian Aquino</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>The concept was to use a song I liked to make a short demo reel of my directorial capabilities. Using the various anime and drama on my hard drive, I decided to try and make as many interesting match cut/on-beat edits as I could. There is a general flow from shot to shot that weaves together a small narrative about letting go of past romantic hang ups. One of my own was the driving force behind the story: "She's less real than she was, but thats ok." The VHS aesthetic was inspired by a friend of mine who works with often and I had a lot of fun putting it all together. </p>
