</h1>21ST CENTURY BOY</h1>
</p>As a child of the modern era, I was born into remix culture. My tastes were shaped by creators who took what they saw in the world and sought to do something new with the influences around them.</P>

</p>In my opinion it is the very essence of geekdom and otakudom is not only to consume the media you enjoy, but to create new media for the rest of the community as well. The result is memetic history of one artistâ€™s great work being perpetually passed down to the next, mutating as need be. In a sense, art is almost like their DNA.</p>

</p>Inspiration is the driving force behind this portfolio.</p>

</p>There is not a single theme more personal to me than paying homage to the creators and people who made me who I am today. The work you are about to see are culminations of my own fringe and niche interests. They are all something that only I could have made, but something I could have never made alone.
