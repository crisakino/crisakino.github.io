<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/304977669">Audio-Visual Transition</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user89620006">Cristian Aquino</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>An in class exercise to display basic mastery of Premiere Pro. I decided to have a little fun with it. The audio is from the OST of the 1998 anime Kareshi to Kanojo no Jijou, which was very recently removed from youtube due to a copyright strike. As far as I am concerned, that makes it lost media. </p>
