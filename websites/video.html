<p>For this video, I was actually up rather late and short on ideas. My roommate helped me by telling me all about the shows he was currently watching, and I put them all together in a way that sort of just made aesthetic sense. During production I happened to find a common theme of weakness and anxiety, as well as a line that really jumped out at me: No matter where you are, everyone is always connected.

The mood is very much just stream of consciousness. I don't think it pulls in any particular direction, but rather gives insight into my roommates thoughts and interests </p>
